# MVA_GeodesicsMethods

In this project, I have implemented the method proposed by
"Baust, M., Yezzi, A. J., Unal, G., & Navab, N. (2011, June).
A sobolev-type metric for polar active contours. In CVPR 2011 (pp. 1017-1024). IEEE." for active polar contours.

### Install requirements
A requirements.txt is proposed to install the needed package.
The code is fully compatible with python 3.6

### Experiments

In the experiments folder, you will find some examples to run the code.
